ðŸŽ¯ Program Requirements
Write a Java program that:

1. Adds 5 student names to a LinkedList<String> to initialize the attendance list.
You can use sample names: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Diana", "Ethan"].

2. Display the full list of students currently marked as present.

3. Simulate an absence by removing a student name (e.g., "Charlie") from the list.

4. Display the updated attendance list after the removal.

5. Print the first and last student in the list using getFirst() and getLast().

6. Print the total number of present students using size().

7. Check if the list is empty, and print a message based on that.

8. Optional Bonus: Try adding a new student (e.g., "Frank") at a specific index (add(index, name)), and show the updated list.


    ðŸ“Œ Beginner Exercise â€“ Attendance List using LinkedList
   
- Add, remove, insert by index
- Use getFirst(), getLast(), size(), isEmpty()
- Display with for loop(or can use for each loop)
